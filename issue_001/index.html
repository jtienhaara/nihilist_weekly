          Chess Masters Officiator Declares State of Emergency
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Chess Masters Officiator Dr. Faustus Gulp, PhD., held a press conference Thursday to declare a state of emergency at the ongoing Fork in the Road Chess Tourney.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "We are living in unprecedented times," Dr. Gulp said.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Fork in the Road Chess Tourney, which takes place every year in the garden shed at the back of the supermarket parking lot, has been locked down to contain the scabies outbreak.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "We have epoxied all of the pieces to the boards," Dr. Gulp said.  "We are taking no chances with this, and we ask that all the chess masters keep their hands off the pieces until further notice."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When asked if the timers would be stopped, Dr. Gulp said he was awaiting further modeling from his chess staff.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The scabies outbreak continues to worsen at the Intercity Chess Tournament in neighbouring Zitzengunsten.  At least 3 people now have uncontrollable urges to scratch their itches.  Models show that as many as 0.1 persons might die in the Zitzengunsten tournament over the next month.
        </p>

        <p class="continued">
          ...Continued from the previous column...
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "We have never before seen Deaths at this scale, people getting Sick in these numbers," Dr. Gulp said.  "Now, more than ever, we must draw a line through the squiggly thing."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          It was pointed out to Dr. Gulp that 1 of last year's Chess Masters, Andreas Vieux, died of tuberculosis in December.  Dr. Gulp explained that the difference is, last December, we weren't capitalizing death and sickness.  "The world has changed," he said, "we have never experienced hardship like this before, and we must live in fear and total control of everyone's movements and thoughts by the board of directors."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Chess Master Officiator has set up a hotline to report on neighbours who touch their chess pieces.  If you suspect your neighbour of violating the state of emergency rules, you are urged to call 111 immediately.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          At the end of the press conference, an epoxied knight fell over.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "Shit," said Dr. Gulp.
        </p>

        <div class="correction">
          CORRECTION: A previous edition of this article erroneously reported that Wednesday's fatal car crash, involving 1 driver and a Chevy Impala, was the result of the scabies outbreak at the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney.  Forensic ontologists could find no connection between the amount of alcohol consumed by the 41-year-old male and the scabies outbreak in neighbouring Zitzengunsten.  The Nihilist regrets conflating this run of the mill death with a scabies Death.

          KAPA Warns of Imminent Industry Collapse
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In a statement released on its website last Friday, the Kites And Parachutes Association of Fork in the Road warned that most major kite and parachute retailers in this city will be bankrupt by the end of the month.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Coordinated government action is needed -- now -- if catastrophe is to be avoided, said the statement.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As the impact of the Great String Entanglement of last summer deepens, the municipal government continues to concentrate its industry relief efforts on rescuing people's old kites from the big red alder tree in Fork in the Road Park.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Mary Piddle, who owns a kite that was caught last summer in the Great String Entanglement, says she wants her old kite back, because it was pretty, and because her stupid husband broke the dishwasher and now she can't afford a new kite.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Others at the Great String Entanglement site echoed her sentiments.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Dave D. David, owner of David David David and Son Kite and Parachute Shop down on Strip Mall Avenue, runs the Fork in the Road chapter of the Kites and Parachutes Association.  He told us, "Cash reserves are running low, and governments are failing to cooperate.  Now is the time to build a better, more competitive and diverse industry for kites, by giving handouts to the kite shops so that they can stay afloat."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          David David David and Son Kite and Parachute Shop, the only place in town to buy kites or parachutes, is closed due to the scabies outbreak, but orders can be placed online at:

          A Play in One Act

        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          My faithful readers can attest to the fact that I'm not one to jump on a bandwagon or heap praise on an overwrought lump of lead.  So it might come as a surprise to some that I absolutely adored Jean-Richard Pauvremousse's latest theatrical production, At the Mutual Fund Bank.  The press in Zitzengunsten has been building it up for weeks.  So when it finally hit the stage at the Polished Brown Globe Theatre here in Fork in the Road, I dreaded the assignment I knew was coming.  Even I was sure I would find something to detest about this production.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          But everything was exquisite.  The thespians undulated with their lines, as though they themselves were caught in the emotional tsunami depicted by this force of nature play.  Particularly brilliant was Bob, who exuded restrained pathos and hurt and fear, and made the audience want to hug him and tell him everything would be all right in the end.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The costumes were period-perfect, middle-class twenty-first century business chic: jeans and T-shirt, and a full three-piece suit.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The set was well-built and not distracting to the casual observer.  Yet the richness of its patterns and the deep beige draperies and wallpaper and the realistic blur of rain on the window all subtely added to the heartwrenching story.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The audio was terrible, but when have you ever heard decent audio at a play.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Above all, Pauvremousse's script was masterful.  I literally cried for five minutes at the end of the show.  Pauvremousse understands crushing loss and heartbreak like no other playwright since Dan Needles.

          At the Mutual Fund Bank plays every night until Tuesday week.  Tickets are $15 each.  Only remote virtual seats are available during the scabies enemapidemic.  Tickets must be picked up at the box office on Wednesday between 6pm and 6:15pm.  Most performances are sold out, so hurry to the box office on Wednesday evening and jostle to be first in line.

          Monthly Fork in the Road Poetry Contest
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          This month, we only had two entries for the Monthly Fork in the Road Poetry Contest, and a note from Ms. Dandy at Fork West Junior High that nobody knows or cares how to read or write anything longer than 280 characters any more, so why do we still bother holding a poetry contest?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          We were forced to disqualify James Ladeeda's submission, because as a male, he must not write from the perspective of any woman, especially not a Chinese one.  Or Korean.  Whatever it was, who can tell the difference, it was something Asian.  We think.  Anyway, we don't actually care, we're really horrible people and deep inside we hate all yellow people; we just couldn't pass up the opportunity to act pious and holier-than-thou and send up this virtue signal.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          We didn't bother to read this month's winning submission.  It was too long, and even holding our phones sideways we couldn't see the ends of some of the lines.  But we know the submitter, Slurpee Gupta, to be an outstanding young poet.  She is a brown woman who grew up in squalor on another continent; she has been raped three and a half times; and her alcoholic husband abuses her.  Need we say more?  We could not have found a more qualified poet if we'd tried.

          Without further ado, here is this month's winning poem.

Inside the hard-edged white
Of this Platonic solid
Mildew-scented, sized for four
Black wheels and metal bod
(Once an unrenovated box,
Exhaust-smeared and oiled purple green,
Populated with rolling green metal blades
Black snake three-copper-fanged tail,
And rusted red-handled autumn comb)
Now gypsum white, insulated,
Carpeted beige
Under turbulent spackled sky,
A forest grows.

A clearing at the centre of of these woods
Panelled walls, like trunks of
Firs
Planted fifty years ago
Grainy, darkened by time
Deep rich puce patina'd pine
Before the rich, wet loam laid the ground this eve
For the forking growth we see unfolding
Before us, branching, reaching outward:
Leaves on a table, veined all in black.

For black is the ink of a proper poet
Like her heart, not blue, it's dead
Dead as the night that falls

While she sings in her black chains like the sea
And pens another tributary requiem
Pens the poetic gorge flowing from within
And earns her fifyeen bucks on time.

If we, voyeurs, could with wings
Fly
To perch
With our long and curving
Protrusions
Of keratin from each toe,
Scythelike and deadly,
Upon the slowly, slightly swishing blades,
A semaphore,
With five dusty, lightly webbed suns
(Four of these cornfloured globes
Blackened by their supernova deaths
Cosmic holes in the torn and tattered fabric
That permeates all things,
Even this cheap Rona ceiling fan)
Flashing
Swish-swish-swish
And from our circulating perch, gaze
With blackened eyes
Curious, head tilting
Black-capped chickadees
Like the kind that roam across the Great White North
Those majestic passerines
That, though Professor McClelland knows it not,
(Still, after four revisions,
McClelland's Masturclass reading list has no 978-1553631200)
Comprise the provincial bird of New Brunswick
With wings striped like zebras
Bellies white as snowflakes on a dovetail,
Chirrupping
In a spinning red alder
With its dangling reddish catkins
10 to 15 cm (3.9 to 5.9 in) long in early spring
Above the black-veined leaves
That cover the ground 'round the roots
Of this rotating red alder tree
        </div>

        <div class="poem">
If we, voyeurs, bewinged and betaloned thus
Spinning
Could only not be dizzy, or puke
Upon the leaves at the forest floor
Then lucky birds would we be
And chirrupp like the metal polyhedron
Walled in its own rectilinear world
Corner inset, lined by breakers
Calling
Chick chick chick chick whoosh
Dry heat pushed through shiny ducts
And up through the forest floor as though a
Swarm
Invisible but felt
Has lifted, sued by
Amphibian:
Prey!
        </div>

        <div class="poem">
From our alder perch we'd see
A great torrent of cold, Pacific brine
Flowing from that pen of hers,
The poet dimly lit who, in this dark forest,
Watched by us black-eyed tits,
In the speculating yellow dusk
Gentle buss of vernal equinox,
Shines
Casting rays of blinding thought
Earning her fifyeen bucks
If she makes her deadline
        </div>

        <div class="poem">
So it is with
Relief
We see the black veins raised above
The surface leaves
And shadows 'twixt the waxy skins
Platonic shadows of the box she's in
Seed this living forest, cacophonous, cyclical,
Seasonal, dying, black,
Alive and white and beige.
        </div>

        <div class="poem">
But wings and talons came not to us at birth
Instead we lie here, drunk, together, cuddling
Atop the flowerbed and earth
Outside the poet's window
Watching as she pours the black sea into leaves
Wondering outside what's in
What's she doing in there?
Is she writing about me?

            Sex and frustration with impotence are the central themes of this poem, and we can see this in the stanza that clearly describes a man masturbating in the window of an apartment as hot young women pass by, until we come all over ourselves:

          New Study Shows Fat Depressed People are Most Vulnerable to Scabies
        </div>
        <div class="article_credit">
          Fork in the Road Press
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          A new study by the University of Zitzengunsten Department of Chemistry and Ultimate Frisbee suggests that fat depressed people might be more likely to contract scabies than physically and mentally healthy people.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          In the experiment, 5 fat depressed people and 5 fat depressed people were left in a room while scabies mites were blown in through the ventilators.  Outside, none of the 10 ultimate frisbee-playing scientists contracted scabies.  But inside, everyone was itching like a motherfucker.

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Zing Dweebat, PhD. student at the University of Zitzengunsten, says the evidence is not conclusive.  "We'd like to try the experiment again, but this time with two groups: one with 6 fat depressed people, the other with 4 fat depressed people.  If we put them in a room and they all get scabies, and we don't get it while we're outside playing frisbee, then that will be a pretty clear indication that locking fat depressed people in a room full of scabies mites makes them the most vulnerable to contracting scabies."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Meanwhile, of the grand masters locked in the garden shed out back of the grocery store for this year's Fork in the Road Chess Tourney, which has been locked down to prevent spread of the scabies infection, at least 64% of players are fat and depressed.  The other 36% should be safe, though, as should the officiators, because no studies have been performed on officiators contracting scabies, and theor blood types are not A.

          Let me give you an example.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Last summer, our dishwasher broke down.  It was my wife's fault: she didn't tell me not to put our big crock pot in the top shelf.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          As always, I'll do my best to bring the incredibly complicated technical events that ensued down to a common level, by explaining what happened in layman's terms: Bang!  Bang!  Bang!  Buddabuddabuddabudda zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz Shploom!
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          When my wife got home from work, she asked what the fuck I'd done, and I told her it's your fault, you didn't tell me not to put the crock pot on the top shelf of the dishwasher, and she said all kinds of uneducated things that I quickly corrected with my deep technical knowledge.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "What are you going to do to fix it?" she asked.
        </p>

        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The dishwasher was broken.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          It was caused by the crockpot.  (Actually it wasn't the crockpot's fault; it was really caused by my wife.)

        <p class="paragraph">
          That day, there was a sale on at the Best Yellow electronics store.  I knew, because I keep flyers.

          Mobile Phone App Review: X-Ray Clothes Remover
        </div>
        <div class="article_credit">
          by Stuart Piddle
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          My wife caught me playing with this new mobile phone app, the X-Ray Clothes Remover, so I decided to start a column reviewing phone apps.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          If you have a mobile phone with an infrared fingerprint sensor, this app is for you.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          X-Ray Clothes Remover allows you to hold your fingerprint scanner out and take a photo or video of a hot chick, like the one who brings your groceries out to the trunk of your car if you shop at the supermarket.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The user interface is unlike anything I've ever seen, so it must be good.  I mean, there were standards developed in the 1980s and into the 1990s for user interfaces, and even whole books written about the academic studies that were done to arrive at those user interface best practices (take, for example, the monstrously long Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice).  But seriously, who wants to read 1,200 pages of that stuff, just to come up with a user interface that is standard and familiar to millions, maybe billions, of users?
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I, for one, am glad that every mobile app comes with a non-standard user interface.  And X-Ray Clothes Remover is the best example of non-standardization I've seen in a long time.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The best part about it is how I can't tell whether the button I'm about to press is part of the app or a paid advertisement for a porn site.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          My friend, Brian the neurologist, says that randomness keeps us learning, keeps us engaged and thinking, especially in a time when nobody has any discipline and can't be bothered reading a book any more.  Brian says: "Respect the unexpected."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          I'm also glad at all the permissions I had to allow in order to use an app to scan women's boobies.  For some reason, X-Ray Clothes Remover won't install without permission to access my camera, my microphone, my email, and my credit card.  Clearly there is some complicated technology going on behind the scenes to show me infrared images of boobies, if all of these permissions are required.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The X-Ray Clothes Remover app works with any phone that has a fingerprint sensor.  I highly recommend it.  But if your wife catches you ogling infrared nipple images of the hot chick down supermarket way, just tell her you're starting a new column, and ask if we have enough pickled cabbage in the cupboard at home.

          Boredom Olympics
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Seventeen competitors convene today at the Trail Behind the Pharmacy for the annual Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Senita Waddlebum, the reigning champion of the 1000m Skiing With Only Poles event, said that she was preparing for the event with a strict diet of barbeque, chips and chardonnay.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "It's so important in these times to keep active," said Waddlebum.  "I'd rather sit on me arse and watch telly, but I have a one-competitor race to win."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "Big" Ben Blanding, last year's upset champion at the 200m Luge Without a Luge event, concurred.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "The number of competitors this year is staggering.  I mean, when you think of the number of lugers even only 2 years ago, compared to now -- Wow!  It's like night and day."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Blanding was the first and only luger to ever compete in the annual Fork in the Road Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics.  While he is still a favourite to win this year's 200m Luge Without a Luge event, some analysts expect this could be the year to end his dynasty.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "I'm not saying," said sports commentator Hablar DeMasiado, on his radio show Sports Bla Bla Bla, "that Ben won't win again this year.  But there is a good chance that the luge will best him.  After all, in 1694, my great-great-great-great grand nephew fourteen times removed had a goals against average of 6.97, and yet the year the Russians killed Rasputin, there were no fewer than three semi-automatic touchdowns in the basketball division of Tennis Fork in the Road.  Now I'm not a stats man, but I'm just saying.  I'm not saying anything.  We shall see, my friends.  We shall see."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics will be broadcast in its entirety on Pay-Per-Torrent, starting this evening at 8pm (7pm if you forgot to set your clock forward).

          Gymnastics Coach Demands Flesh or Compensation
        </div>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Handen Pykkle, head coach of the Fork in the Road Gymnastics Association, held a press conference Thursday to address the ongoing gymnasium and clubhouse closures due to the scabies outbreak at the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "The girls are being very brave," said Pykkle, who has been communicating with them via SMS text messages.  "Some of their parents, not so much.  Sophia's dad, if you're out there, give your daughter her phone back.  She is a free young woman and she can choose to view whatever she likes."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Pykkle came under fire 2 seasons ago from the Fork in the Road Athletics Association, which claimed he had not molested at least two of the underage girls enrolled in the gymnastics program.  He has been trying to keep up with expectations and urges ever since.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          "I gotta tell you,", he said, in a rare, emotional moment.  "It's been hard.  I don't know how I'm going to diddle all these young ladies if the government keeps me locked out of the gym and clubhouse.  Damn it, though, I will do everything in my power to make sure they are equipped with the proper physical and emotional scars for life that are expected and demanded of female gymnasts."
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          Pykkle went on to petition the municipal government to provide counselling and financial relief to him for the distress caused by not being able to rape and psychologically manipulate fourteen year old girls.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          The Fork in the Road Athletics Association said it was aware of the problem facing Head Coach Pykkle, and that it is working with Mayor Perkele on a solution.

          We praise you, community leaders, for staying home in fear, staying safe, and positively ruining everyone else's mood.  It is in times like these that we must have leaders we can depend on to make this bad situation worse.
        </p>

        <p class="paragraph">
          If our community leaders were to take risks by organizing online social events or offering to help those in need, they might get scabies, and then who would we have to lead us?  We need our leaders to stay safe and be fearful and miserable and neglect their leadership roles completely so that we can depend on them to continue leading us.

          To our readers, guppies that you are, we encourage you to accept all these social media blasts about how evil and inhuman it is to go outside or how important it is to clean under the foreskin, accept these social media blasts with the positivity and resignation that make you such good consumerist guppies.

          Thank you to all of the frontline workers at the supermarket, merely 100 metres away from the shed where the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney is taking place.  You are the wind beneath our wings.

          3 individuals have contracted scabies at the Intercity Chess Tournament in neighbouring town Zitzengunsten.

          It is unknown whether any of the chess masters at the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney will ever succumb to Death or Sickness, or become really, really itchy.  But in these trying times, it is people like the supermarket checkout staff who keep hope alive for all of the rest of us weak-kneed, fearful tadpoles.

          Today's joke was submitted by Zing Dweebat, a PhD. student in Chemistry and Ultimate Frisbee at the University of Zitzengunsten, who specializes in applying non-deterministic hyperstring theory to concocting expensive proprietary pharmaceuticals for industrial clients while using publicly funded university facilities, and patenting her creations, and throwing discs very, very far.
