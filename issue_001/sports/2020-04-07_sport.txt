Seventeen competitors convene today at the Trail Behind the Pharmacy for the annual Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics.

Senita Waddlebum, the reigning champion of the 1000m Skiing With Only Poles event, said that she was preparing for the event with a strict diet of barbeque, chips and chardonnay.

"It's so important in these times to keep active," said Waddlebum.  "I'd rather sit on me arse and watch telly, but I have a one-competitor race to win."

"Big" Ben Blanding, last year's upset champion at the 200m Luge Without a Luge event, concurred.

"The number of competitors this year is staggering.  I mean, when you think of the number of lugers even only 2 years ago, compared to now -- Wow!  It's like night and day."

Blanding was the first ever luger to compete in the annual Fork in the Road Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics.  While he is still a favourite to win this year's 200m Luge Without a Luge event, some analysts expect this could be the year to end his dynasty.

"I'm not saying," said sports commentator Hablar DeMasiado, on his radio show Sports Bla Bla Bla, "that Ben won't win again this year.  But there is a good chance that the luge will best him.  After all, in 1694, my great-great-great-great grand nephew fourteen times removed had a goals against average of 6.97 and yet the same year the Russians killed Rasputin, there were no fewer than three semi-automatic touchdowns in the basketball division of Tennis Fork in the Road.  Now I'm not a stats man, but I'm just saying.  I'm not saying anything.  We shall see, my friends.  We shall see."

The Fat Middle-Aged Boredom Olympics will be broadcast in its entirety on Pay-Per-Torrent, starting this evening at 8pm (7pm if you forgot to set your clock forward).
