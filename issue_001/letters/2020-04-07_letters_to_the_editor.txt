Dear Sirs,

Yesterday I saw Someone walk within 20 metres of the shed behind the supermarket.  I dare say we ought to bring back corporal punishment, and strap that young rapscallion with twenty-first century vinyl vegan leather substitute.

Yours et cetera, hub ub,

Aloysius Cumberbatch, Esq., OBE

Dear Sirs,

I am a Little Old Lady and I went hungry for five years during the Great Depression and I was an aviation mechanic during the Second World War.  I just want to thank you for all you're doing to help those in need and keep us all full of hope.  I can't remember anything between the ages of 12 and 93, but I'm sure it was publications such as yours that kept me going.

Delicately yours,

Pauvrella Meillervie

Dear Sirs,

Fuck you for laying me off just because I published "The Status Quo: Is It Really As Good As It's Cracked Up To Be?"

Andy Stablusman

The Editors respond:

Dear Andy,

In times like these, we need all of the Big Pharma money we can get.  And to be truthful, since nobody reads Letters to the Editor anyway, we laid you off because you were poking your nose into internal #MeToo scandals.  We didn't want you finding out what we're up to.  So fuck you, too.

Regrettably yours,

The Editors

Dear Sirs,

Am I the only person who is glad we've got something to be fearful of besides towel-heads with matches in between their toes?

Yours,

Anne Greewichuk

The Editors respond:

Dear Anne,

We concur with your sentiments.  Extreme Islam and insane little brown people running around blowing things up and raping white women just don't sell newspapers like they used to.  Here's to the scabies outbreak, and keeping nihilist writers and editors employed.

Hey,

So I walk by this Boomer on the sidewalk, right?  And she's all like: Euh!  Don't you know there's a scabies outbreak?  It's important to keep 6 feet and both hands distant!  So I'm like: OK, Boomer.  Amirite?

Punky GenXer

The Editors respond:

Right on, GenXer.  Baby Boomers caused scabies.  It didn't exist before them.  Nothing did.
