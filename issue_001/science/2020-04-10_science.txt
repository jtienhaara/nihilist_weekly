New Study Shows Fat Depressed People are Most Vulnerable to Scabies

A new study by the University of Zitzengunsten Department of Chemistry and Ultimate Frisbee suggests that fat depressed people might be more likely to contract scabies than physically and mentally healthy people.

In the experiment, 5 fat depressed people and 5 fat depressed people were lefy in a room while scabies mites were blown in through the ventilators.  Outside, none of the 10 ultimate frisbee-playing scientists contracted scabies.  But inside, everyone was itching like a motherfucker.

Zing Dweebat, PhD. student at the University of Zitzengunsten, says the evidence is not conclusive.  "We'd like to try the experiment again, but this time with two groups: one with 6 fat depressed people, the other with 4 fat depressed people.  If we put them in a room and they all get scabies, and we don't get it while we're outside playing frisbee, then that will be a pretty clear indication that locking fat depressed people in a room full of scabies mites makes them the most vulnerable to contracting scabies."

Meanwhile, of the players locked in the garden shed out back of the grocery store for this year's Fork in the Road Chess Tourney, which has been locked down to prevent spread of the scabies infection, at least 64% of players are fat and depressed.  The other 36% should be safe, though, as should the officiators, because no studies have been performed on officiators contracting scabies, and theor blood types are not A.
