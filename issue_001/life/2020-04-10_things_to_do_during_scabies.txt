Things to Do During the Scabies Outbreak

1. Feed acid to your dog, see if she discovers quantum physics.

2. Pour Listerine into your neighbour's heating oil, give their home a breath of fresh minty air.

3. Start a bonfire at the condominium construction site down on English Muffin Avenue.  Leave marhsmallows and hot chocolate for whoever shows up.

4. Phone Mayor Perkele at home, ask him in Finnish how his pecker's hanging.  Send us his response via email or Twitter.

5. Click furiously through comics at www.kurtvonnegutfamilycircus.com.

6. Climb on your neighbour's roof and drop marbles down the chimney.

7. Call 811 to report that your weird neighbour is drawing comics and laughing maniacally again.  Ask if you can have a free sample.

8. Start a newspaper.

9. Develop a new type system for computer science so that programmers everywhere won't have to continually code checks for the lengths of strings, the validities of structures, or the bounded values of numbers, over and over and over, all of which have supposedly already been typechecked.

10. Start a religion or political party, and write a 280 character manifesto describing how it is completely different from every religion / political party that came before.
