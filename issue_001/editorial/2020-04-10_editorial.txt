Leadership in Dark Times

In these trying times, it is important to keep positive while doing the right thing.

That's why today we praise the efforts of our community leaders, the people we've looked up to for years for guidance and direction, the people who have made our lives easier and more fun.

Our community leaders are staying positive and safe and doing the right thing by staying home and blasting everyone on social media with dire warnings of Death and Sickness.

We praise you, community leaders, for staying home in fear, staying safe, and positively ruining everyone else's mood.  It is in times like these that we must have leaders we can depend on to make this bad situation worse.

If our community leaders were to take risks by organizing online social events or offering to help those in need, they might get scabies, and then who would we have to lead us?  We need our leaders to stay safe and be fearful and miserable and neglect their leadership roles completely so that we can depend on them to continue leading us.

To our readers, guppies that you are, we encourage you to accept all these social media blasts about how evil and inhuman it is to go outside or how important it is to clean under the foreskin, accept these social media blasts with the positivity and resignation that make you such a good consumerist guppy.

Here's to positivity and leadership,

The Editors
