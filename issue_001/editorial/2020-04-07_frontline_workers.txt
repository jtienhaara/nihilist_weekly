The editors of this journal wish to thank and applaud all of the heroes facing these troubled times with bravery and determination:

Thank you to all of the frontline workers at the supermarket, merely 100 metres away from the shed where the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney is taking place.  You are the wind beneath our wings.

3 individuals have contracted scabies at the Chess Tournament 2020 in neighbouring town Zitzengunsten.  It is unknown whether any of the chess masters at the Fork in the Road Chess Tourney will ever succumb to Death or Sickness, or become really, really itchy.  But in these trying times, it is people like the supermarket checkout staff who keep hope alive for all of the rest of us weak-kneed, fearful tadpoles.

Thank you, heroes!
