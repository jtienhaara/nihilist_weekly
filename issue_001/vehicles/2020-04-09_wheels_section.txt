Test drive: 2020 white SUV

The new 2020 white SUV is whiter than last year's white, especially after all the salt that was dumped on the roads here in Fork in the Road during the Great Snowjob back in February.

In a stunning new development for the industry, it has four wheels, and none of them is square.

We predict this amazing new vehicle will be on the Best Of list for this year.  However we're waiting with bated breath to find out how awesome the black and chrome models are.  There's even a rumour that there will be a 2020 blue SUV, but we hope they save that one for next year, because with all these in-depth SUV reviews, we're just not going to have time to drive them all.

Rev your engines, SUV lovers!  Even more than last year, this year is the year to buy an SUV.

Or a pickup truck.
