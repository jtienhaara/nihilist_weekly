Joke of the Day
Today's joke was submitted by Zing Dweebat, a PhD. student in Chemistry and Ultimate Frisbee at the University of Zitzengunsten, who specializes in applying non-deterministic hyperstring theory to concocting expensive proprietary pharmaceuticals for industrial clients using university facilities, and patenting her creations, and throwing discs very, very far.

Bill had a hard-edged beginning.

He came from the wrong side of town.

His dad wasted his days wrapped around the Klein Bottle.

So his mom had to spread herself thin.  She wound up in the Moebius strip club circuit just to make ends meet.

It's no wonder Bill turned out two-faced.
